To Do
=====

Functional Test Level
---------------------

Add functional tests for db.delete(package, version=None)
Think about query functions (mainly for tests)
Functional tests currently do not init each new DB!
    - Refactor into dbinit test and put init into setUp of main tests
    - Do not do anything until a test fails, though!

Unittest Level
--------------

Refactoring
-----------

Using duplicate detection in the commit/rollback test - fix to directly test
for data in the DB
